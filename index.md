## What is the Co-Design Winter School?

The complexification of simulation models and computing architecture make the interaction between scientists from all fields necessary. This is the heart of Co-Design. 
As a part of the Co-Design collaboration between the National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA) and the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) we propose a Co-Design Winter School: classes on subjects on edge of research directly used in the national laboratories of both USA and France. 


## What is Co-Design?

Co-Design is the social and technical equivalent of a multiple-constraint optimization problem. The rapid evolution of computing architectures and the expanding space between specializations in domain science and computer architecture means that it is virtually impossible for a single individual to cover all of the skills needed to solve current-day computational science challenges. Co-Design bridges this space through interactions between members of an interdisciplinary team. With the right amount of overlap, team members can communicate with each other effectively to solve a problem.

## 2024 Co-Design Winter School Focus:

The current physical limitations have kept the speed of processor cores constrained. These limitations made the way for more parallelism. The supercomputers have grown to millions of cores or thousands of nodes which are harder to target using legacy methods such as bulk synchronous parallelism. In this context, task-based parallelism provides a promising path forward. Tools like FleCSI[^1], MPC[^2], Pygion[^3], and many others simplify the programming of heterogeneous supercomputers by providing sequential semantics. 
The intent of this yearâ€™s Co-Design Winter School is to give to the students all the tools to step into the world of task-based parallelism. With classes from actors at the edge of computer science research, the school proposes a mix of lectures and hands-on to get familiar with the concepts of task-based parallelism and several software/frameworks implementing them.
